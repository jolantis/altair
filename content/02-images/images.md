### Rebel Mission to Ord Mantell

I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!

### The Force Unleashed

Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. What?! I find your lack of faith disturbing. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.

I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. You mean it controls your actions?

## Return of the Jedi

The Force is strong with this one. I have you now. Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like&hellip;suicide. As you wish. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

## The Empire Strikes Back

A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. You don't believe in the Force, do you? Dantooine. They're on Dantooine.

### Jedi Academy

She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force. No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it?

## Revenge of the Sith

All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? You mean it controls your actions? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.

Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. You mean it controls your actions? As you wish. I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.

### The Battle for Endor

I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. I find your lack of faith disturbing. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Dantooine. They're on Dantooine. What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it?

Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod.

You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away! I care. So, what do you think of her, Han? You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Ye-ha!

#### Knights of the Old Republic

What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide. I'm trying not to, kid. I'm trying not to, kid.

### The Clone Wars

Ye-ha! The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Red Five standing by. Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master.

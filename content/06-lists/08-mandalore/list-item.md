Title: Mandalore

----

Text: 

Mandalore was a planet located in the Outer Rim Territories. It was the homeworld of the Mandalorians, a fearsome and warmongering people who fought the Jedi and sacked their temple during the fall of the Old Republic. Wearing distinctive armor, they were feared throughout the galaxy.

Years of war left the planet inhospitable, forcing the Mandalorians to live within domed cities. A pacifist regime came to power at the end of these wars, led by Duchess Satine Kryze, while those who refused to give up their warrior ways were exiled to the moon Concordia. During the Clone Wars, the New Mandalorians were overthrown by Darth Maul's Shadow Collective, though the Galactic Empire would rule the planet after the war's end.

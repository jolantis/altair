Title: Lothal

----

Text: 

Lothal was a planet in the Outer Rim Territories. It was in a state of economic disrepair and invited the Galactic Empire with the promise of prosperity and security. Despite welcoming the Empire, the Lothalites became disillusioned with the Empire's repressive policies and the pollution of their world. Several years before the Battle of Yavin, Lothal became the nesting ground for the Spectres, a small rebel cell which operated from the starship Ghost. After harrying Imperial forces and disrupting Imperial activities for at least a year, the Spectres eventually attracted the attention of Grand Moff Wilhuff Tarkin and Darth Vader, who tried unsuccessfully to stamp out these rebels. Vader even imposed a blockade on the planet, but the Spectres managed to slip through and rejoin the larger rebellion.

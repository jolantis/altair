Title: Vodran

----

Text: 

Vodran was a murky, humid planet in the Si'Klaata Cluster, on the Ac'fren Spur of Hutt Space. Its surface featured jungles and swamps, and was home to the reptilian Vodran. It was also the original planet where the garbage eating dianoga evolved, a pest that eventually spread throughout the galaxy.

The planet was taken over by the Hutts under the Treaty of Vontor in 25,100 BBY. It was later brutally subjugated by the Galactic Empire, which destroyed many of the world's cities.

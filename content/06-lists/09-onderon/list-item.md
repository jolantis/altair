Title: Onderon

----

Text: 

Onderon was a jungle world located within the Inner Rim. During the Clone Wars, it aligned itself with the Confederacy of Independent Systems; in the Separatist Senate, Onderon was represented by Senator Mina Bonteri and later by her son, Lux Bonteri. When Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine turned the Republic into the Galactic Empire and declared himself as the Emperor, the planet was taken over by the Imperials. This gave the rebirth of the Onderon rebels once more, now led by Saw Gerrera.

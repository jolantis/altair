Title: Ord Mantell

Text: 

Ord Mantell was a planet that housed a base of operations for the criminal syndicate Black Sun during the Clone Wars. A battle was fought on the planet between the Shadow Collective, in which Black Sun was a member, and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. During the Galactic Civil War, Han Solo and the Rebel Alliance encountered a bounty hunter on Ord Mantell.
